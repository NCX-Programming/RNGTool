## Modes:
- Numbers only
- Dice
- Cards

### Numbers
Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. The simplest way to generate numbers.
### Dice
Generate up to 6 random numbers using dice with 6-20 sides. Now featuring dice icons showing your rolls when using 6-sided dice.
### Cards
Generate up to 5 random numbers using cards. You can display the numbers, cards drawn, and the point values of them. Will output the cards as either only numbers (1-13), or including face cards (Ace, 1-10, Jack, Queen, King). The point value is toggleable and you can change whether the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points.
### Marbles
Generate up to 5 random numbers and letters using marbles. Marble icons are shown with the letter on them. You can also show a list of letters below the list of numbers.
