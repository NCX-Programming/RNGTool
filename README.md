## Modes:
- Numbers only
- Dice
- Cards
### Numbers
Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. The simplest way to generate numbers.
### Dice
Generate up to 6 random numbers using dice with 6-20 sides. Now featuring dice icons showing your rolls when using 6-sided dice.
### Cards
Generate up to 5 random numbers using cards. You can display the numbers, cards drawn, and the point values of them. Will output the cards as either only numbers (1-13), or including face cards (Ace, 1-10, Jack, Queen, King). The point value is toggleable and you can change whether the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points.
## System Requirements
- At least macOS 11.3 or higher
## Installation
GitHub Actions automatically builds RNGTool and then creates a DMG installer for it every time we push a commit. You can access those from [here](https://github.com/NCX-Programming/RNGTool/actions). You will have to Right Click > Open the first time you try and run the program in order to get past Gatekeeper, as unfortunately these binaries are not signed. An auto-generated checksum is also available if you'd like to verify the file before installing it.
